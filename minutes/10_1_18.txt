IR hat (sophie + brandon):
-rebuilt the non inverting amplifier and bandpass filter on a smaller breadboard

filter values
C1 = 100nF
R1 = 330 Ohms (to ground)
C2 = 1nF
R2 = 24 kOhms (to output)

op amp values
R1 = 100kOhms
R2 = 100 Ohms

resistor that connects in series
R = 330 Ohms

Texas Instruments LM358P

-we repositioned the arduino and battery pack on the lower level of the robot
-our IR hat is 6.5 inches above the groundâ€”is that okay?

-IR hat detects 4.25in away
